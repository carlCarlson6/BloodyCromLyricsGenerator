We enter the dungeon
through a large door
Nothing moves here
everything is quiet
At the end of the corridor
Appears a scabrous room

Dungeon

Dungeon

We are in a grimmy room
Full of rat men, full of bloody bats
We cast a fire spell
And starts to burn the cave

Dungeon

Dungeon
Dungeon

Some goblins come for us
Green skin and rusty armours
The sword cuts heads
We can continue the quest

We have cut the bridge
Evil beast can´t no pass
The elf now is dead
But we have complete the quest

I came from another dimension
I drink souls from you´ll every friend
I´m a part of a demon race
My brother is the Mournblade

To be wielded by the king
The black sword from the Chaos
Now you serve, you are my slave
My power it´s your drug

Kill, drink, do it again
Obey me now
Obey me now
Until the battle of law and chaos
Kill the eternal champion

I´ll make you hate yourself
I´ll make you cut everyone
Stormbringer Master of the weak King
Cruelty of another world

To be wielded by the king
the black sword from the chaos
Now you serve you are my slave
Thousand times more evil than thou

Kill, drink, do it again
Obey me now
Obey me now
Until the battle of law and chaos
Kill the eternal champion

	
Four gods for the chaos
Waiting in the dead cold north
Four brothers in the dark
Ancient portal of magic

Beastman spread the dead
Bloodthirster brings hell
Pleaguebearer will rot
Realms of chaos till end

Mutations for the men
The precious gift of chaos
It´s time to begin
The final march through the world

Beastman spread the dead
Bloodthirster brings hell
Pleaguebearer will rot
Realms of chaos till end

Marching though the snow
Spread the vision of them
You can only hear
Voice of madness and filth

Beastman spread the dead
Bloodthirster brings hell
Pleaguebearer will rot
Realms of chaos till end

The chamber of Mazarbul it´s full of dead dwarfs
They coming on the book, they coming in the dark
The goblin and the troll they want to kill you all
The bow of the elf starts to sing aloud

Escaping though this mine you have to reach the bridge
The wizards knows the secret of this empty place
They found it in the darkness, the Durin´s Bane
A demon of the abyss from the Morgoth hand

This is a foe behind any of you
The wizard looks the fire eyes
Uduns flame brights so bad
You shall not pass

All begin nine hundred years ago in land
In a world involved in a war
People was destroyed in mass
My people was too

Black magic against my sword
I´ll be soon
He is there in the tower
He will die in his castle by me tonight
I´ll do with my axe

Warlock in the tower smoking the grass
Warlock in the tower
Warlock in the tower
Warlock in the tower
Warlock in the tower
