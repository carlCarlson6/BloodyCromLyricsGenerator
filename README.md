# BloodyCromLyricsGenerator

Bloody Crom is a Stoner Punk band where is used to play bass guitar. While taking the Udemy free course "Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch" I decided to take the text generator example with the lyrics of my previous band.

In this repository you while find the code to train, use and deploy the lyrics generator models in a object orientated programming way.
